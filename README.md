## Usman Jamil

As an entrepreneurial personality, I strive to take on challenges that could have a positive impact on those around me. I have increased revenue for two family run businesses and worked on a start-up project that failed but progressively inspired me to learn how to code. I’d like to work as a junior developer for an exciting company with a culture in which everyone is a hands-on contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. The ideal environment would consist of passionate individuals, be energetic, humorous and innovative.

## Skills

#### Programming

- I have created an [Instagram](https://usmaninstagram.herokuapp.com/) clone built using Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord and AWS S3. It is fully tested using RSpec and Capybara. This project allowed me to understand the usability of cloud services such as S3 and also strengthened my knowledge on associations in ActiveRecord.
- [DrWow](http://drwhoteam.herokuapp.com) was my final project at Makers Academy. A simple web application to allow doctors to consult patients over the internet. This was built using the MEAN stack, OpenTok API and Mandrill API. One of my many responsibilities was to implement the OpenTok WebRTC API which was one of the main features of the application.

#### Analytical

My ability to analytically solve problems by making calculated decisions using the information available has developed through my experience at university years and also in the working world.

- My dissertation at university required me to think analytically and decide on a formula for road tires which I thought would be most efficient for UK roads.
- When purchasing my flat, I decided on purchasing the property that I believed would deliver the best overall return in a five-year period. I decided to go for a property which is currently returning a 7.4% rental yield and has increased in value by 3% in 10 months.

#### Manage time efficiently

Prioritizing things that need to be completed first and getting them done before moving on to things that are not a priority allows me to manage my time efficiently.

- Completing mini programming tasks in a given time period whilst having other work commitments
- Worked part time during the Makers Academy’s intensive course
- Meet deadlines both in work and academic environments

#### Exceptional teamwork abilities

Having been part of a number of teams, I have grown to be a team player that can constantly motivate his team and keeps team spirits high.

- Pair programming on a daily basis allowed me motivate those whom I work with and also to understand their thought process.
- Working as a team for my final project was another invaluable experience of working as a team. Sharing ideas, bouncing thoughts of each other and encouraging team members to believe they can do it when they are feeling low.

#### Passionate Learner

As well as being an enthusiastic team worker and a passionate leader, I love to learn and thus am very coachable.

- Learnt how to code in 12 weeks at Makers Academy – can be seen on my GitHub
- I learnt about tax and in return was able to discuss strategies with accountants in order to keep tax costs to a minimum in my family business
- Self-taught XCode in order to make UI designs for a start-up having never used it before

#### Confident when working individually

When working alone, I am able to motivate myself and avoid being discouraged by the fear of failing. I have worked on a start-up, which enhanced my ability to keep going when working independently, and my ‘can do ‘ mentality allows me to push myself outside of my comfort zone.

- I had a business idea so I planned it and executed it alone.
- I built the complete set of wireframes for a start-up using LucidChart and hired developers to build my idea – [RentalHunt](http://rental.thedigitalmarketingonline.com/). This is when I realized my lack of programming knowledge was a deterrent to my success and the urge to learn how to code became unbearable.
