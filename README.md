## Usman Jamil

As an entrepreneurial personality, I strive to take on challenges that could have a positive impact on those around me. I have increased revenue for two family run businesses and worked on a start-up project that failed but progressively inspired me to learn how to code. I’d like to work as a junior developer for an exciting company with culture in which everyone is a hands-on contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. The ideal environment would be energetic, humorous and innovative.

## Skills

#### Analytical

My ability to analytically solve problems by making calculated decisions using the information available has developed through my experience at university years and also in the working world.

- My dissertation at university required me to think analytically and decide on a formula for road tires which I thought would be most efficient for UK roads.
- When purchasing my flat, I decided on purchasing the property that I believed would deliver the best overall return in a five-year period.

#### Manage time efficiently

Prioritizing things that need to be completed first and getting them done before moving on to things that are not a priority allows me to manage my time efficiently.

- Completing mini programming tasks in a given time period whilst having other work commitments
- Worked part time during the Makers Academy’s intensive course
-  Meet deadlines both in work and academic environments

#### Exceptional teamwork abilities

Having been part of a number of teams, I have grown to be a team player that can constantly motivate his team and keeps team spirits high.

- I contributed to the development of an online consultation website for the Makers Academy final project
- I implemented the OpenTok API and contributed to the implementation of MongoDB

#### Coachable individual

As well as being an enthusiastic team worker and a passionate leader, I love to learn and thus am very coachable. I like to listen to others and try out new things to enhance my ability.

- I learnt how to code in 12 weeks at Makers Academy – can be seen on my GitHub
- I learnt about tax in order to keep tax costs to a minimum in my family business
- I made UI designs using XCode for a start-up prior to having never used it before

#### Confident when working individually

When working alone, I am able to motivate myself and avoid being discouraged by the fear of failing. I have worked on a start-up, which enhanced my ability to keep going when working independently, and my ‘can do ‘ mentality allows me to push myself outside of my comfort zone.

- I had a business idea so I planned it and executed it alone.
- I built the complete set of wireframes for a start-up using LucidChart and hired developers to build my idea – this is when I realized my lack of programming knowledge was a deterrent to my success and the urge to learn how to code became unbearable.
