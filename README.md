## Usman Jamil

Due to my entrepreneurial personality, I strive to take on challenges that could have a positive impact on those around me. I have increased revenue for two family run businesses in the last year and a half. I also worked on a start-up project that failed but progressively inspired me to learn how to code. I’d like to work as a junior developer for an exciting company with a culture in which everyone is a hands-on contributor and feels comfortable sharing ideas and opinions. The ideal environment would consist of passionate individuals, be energetic, humorous and innovative.

## Skills

#### Programming

- I have created an [Instagram](https://usmaninstagram.herokuapp.com/) clone built using Ruby on Rails, ActiveRecord and AWS S3. It is fully tested using RSpec and Capybara. This project allowed me to understand the usability of cloud services such as S3 and also strengthened my knowledge on associations in ActiveRecord.
- [DrWow](http://drwhoteam.herokuapp.com) was my final project at Makers Academy. A simple web application to allow doctors to consult patients over the internet. This was built using the MEAN stack, OpenTok API and Mandrill API. One of my many responsibilities was to implement the OpenTok WebRTC API which was one of the main features of the application.

#### Analytical

-	When hiring developers for my start-up, I had to make an informed decision from the information I had available. I analysed their previous work, the time frames in which they completed projects, specialist skills amongst the team and also the quote that they were providing me with.
-	I was given the opportunity to be a buyer’s agent for a client when he wanted to purchase an investment property. Having compared numerous properties in his price range, I advised him to purchase the property that I believed would deliver the best overall return in a five-year period. The property in question is currently returning a 7.4% rental yield and has increased in value by 3% in 10 months.


#### Project Management

- Managed a team of 4 when working on my start-up. Used Basecamp to organize daily and weekly tasks that needed to completed. Conducted daily Skype calls to keep the entire team up to date with the project's progress.
- Managed drivers simultaneously when working for Legend Chauffeurs. Ensuring drivers are in the right place at the right time and catering for any special requests from clients.

#### Exceptional teamwork abilities

Having been part of a number of teams, I have grown to be a team player that can constantly motivate his team and keeps team spirits high.

- Worked with developers in India on two various projects. Although we had a 5 hour time difference, we religiously communicated on a daily basis. Usually they sent me queries in the morning every morning at 6am GMT which I answered by 8am GMT. We then had a call at 10am GMT.
- Working as a team for my final project was another invaluable experience of working as a team. Sharing ideas, bouncing thoughts of each other and encouraging team members to believe they can do it when they are feeling low.

#### Passionate Learner

As well as being an enthusiastic team worker and a passionate leader, I love to learn and thus am very coachable.

- Learnt how to code in 12 weeks at Makers Academy – can be seen on my GitHub
- I learnt about corporate and income tax and in return was able to discuss strategies with accountants in order to keep tax liabilities to a minimum in my family business
- Self-taught XCode in order to make UI designs for a start-up having never used it before

#### Confident when working individually

When working alone, I am able to motivate myself and avoid being discouraged by the fear of failing. I have worked on a start-up, which enhanced my ability to keep going when working independently, and my ‘can do‘ mentality allows me to push myself outside of my comfort zone.

- I had a business idea so I planned it and executed it alone. I built the complete set of wireframes for a start-up using LucidChart and hired developers to build my idea – [RentalHunt](http://rental.thedigitalmarketingonline.com/). This is when I realized my lack of programming knowledge was a deterrent to my success and the urge to learn how to code became unbearable.
